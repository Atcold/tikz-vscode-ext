Syntax highlighting for TikZ inside LaTeX documents, with commands to build and view the
figure you are editing.

```tex
\draw [->, ultra thick, shorten >=1pt] (eps) -- (0,\eps);
```

Stock LaTeX grammars colour that as one undifferentiated line. Here `->` is an operator,
`ultra thick` a style reference, `shorten >` a key, `1pt` a number with its unit, `--` a
path join, `(eps)` a coordinate and `\eps` a variable — because the file `\def`s it two
lines up. Every token maps to a conventional TextMate scope with a `.tikz` suffix, so the
colours come from whichever theme you use.

![The same two lines with the extension on: \eps amber where it is defined and where it is used, \draw still cyan, and the arrow tip, the option key, the style, the dimension, the path join and the coordinate each with a colour of their own.](images/highlighting.png)

*The same two lines as the editor draws them: `\eps` is amber at its `\def` and again
at its use, while `\draw` stays cyan — a distinction no grammar can make on its own.*

## Building a figure

Bind the two commands to keys, in `keybindings.json`:

```jsonc
{ "key": "f6", "command": "runCommands",
  "args": { "commands": ["workbench.action.files.saveAll", "tikz.build"] },
  "when": "!terminalFocus" },
{ "key": "f7", "command": "tikz.view", "when": "!terminalFocus" }
```

`F6` builds and reports the outcome in a notification; `F7` hands the PDF to an
external viewer. Both act on the file you are looking at — one in a figure folder counts
as a figure, anything else as the document.

The extension does not build anything itself. `F6` runs a shell script from your
project, because only your project knows which preamble a figure has to compile
against, and guessing that is how a build tool becomes a build system. Copy
`examples/fig.sh` and `examples/build.sh` into your project and change the preamble
line. Each script is given the figure's path as `$1`, runs from the folder it was found
in, and reports by writing one line to `build/.build-status`, either `ok <message>` or
`fail <message>`; without that file the exit code is used. Press `F6` with no script in
place and the editor will offer you the example.

`TikZ: Rebuild style index` re-scans the workspace for `/.style` definitions.

## Install

```sh
./tools/package
code --install-extension tikz-vscode-ext-0.1.0.vsix
```

Reload the window, then merge `settings-snippet.jsonc` into your user `settings.json`;
its `editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations.enabled` line is required, as many themes
ship semantic highlighting off. `./tools/tm tools/theme-check.mjs` reports the tokens
your theme leaves the colour of ordinary text, to be given one there.

## Layout

What the defaults expect, all of it adjustable below:

```
your-project/
└── latex/                  ← searched for the scripts: tikz.scriptFolders
    ├── main.tex
    ├── preamble.tex
    ├── fig.sh              ← copied from examples/
    ├── build.sh
    ├── ch1-figs/           ← a figure folder: tikz.figureFolders
    │   └── flowchart.tex
    └── build/
        ├── fig.pdf         ← tikz.figurePdf
        ├── main.pdf        ← tikz.documentPdf
        └── .build-status   ← what the script reports back
```

The scripts are looked for in each `tikz.scriptFolders` entry in turn and the first hit
wins, so sources can sit in a subdirectory or at the root. A file counts as a figure when
the name of the folder holding it matches `tikz.figureFolders`; the PDFs are resolved
against the same folder as the scripts.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `tikz.figureScript` | `./fig.sh` | script for a figure |
| `tikz.buildScript` | `./build.sh` | script for the document |
| `tikz.figureFolders` | `(?:[A-Za-z0-9_]+-figs\|tikz-figs\|tikz-code)` | folder names holding figures |
| `tikz.scriptFolders` | `[".", "latex"]` | where the scripts and PDFs are, searched in order |
| `tikz.figurePdf` | `build/fig.pdf` | PDF to view from a figure |
| `tikz.documentPdf` | `build/main.pdf` | PDF to view otherwise |
| `tikz.viewer` | `""` | viewer application; empty means the newest `/Applications/texstudio*.app` |
